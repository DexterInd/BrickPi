SimpleBot Model
=====

These are the design files for the BrickPi SimpleBot robot, developed by Dexter Industries.

The SimpleBot as its name says is one of the simplest bot that you can build with the BrickPi. It is a 2 wheeled robot with a very easy to build chassis. We have added examples in the Github Repo for both Python(https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi/tree/master/Software/BrickPi_Python/Project_Examples/simplebot) and C(https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi/tree/master/Software/BrickPi_C/Project_Examples/simplebot) using which you can get this bot running directly from WiFi or use a PSP Controller to control the bot.
